      <p class = "lead">
        “Borahae” is a Korean phrase that translates to “I purple you” and is
        used as a term of endearment and affection. The phrase combines two
        Korean words: bora (violet) and saranghae (I love you).So as an ARMY(Fan
        of BTS) i created this library in their name. Here you will find all the
        books that I love and the books that BTS members recommended and many
        more books that anyone can read.
